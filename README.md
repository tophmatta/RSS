# RSS

This project consists of creating an RSS feed that pulls articles from the web, specifically theverge.com, and 
compiles them into a table view for one's viewing pleasure. The project flow was quite different being that the 
project has multiple views, pulls information from the aforementioned website, and parses it in a new, more advanced
fashion to break out the different elements of the articles.

Skills learned:
- Using navigation controller
- Multiple view controllers
- Segues
- Delegates
- Protocols
- Parsing an .xml file
- Table views
